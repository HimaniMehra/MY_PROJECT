# MY_PROJECT
A collection of my hands-on projects in Python. Built with curiosity, learning, and a passion for tech!
ðŸ”· Just built two interactive GUI applications using Python & Tkinter
ðŸ“Œ Focused on clean design, functionality & real-time response.

ðŸ•’ 1. Digital Clock
â€“ Displays real-time system time in HH:MM:SS format
â€“ Used Pythonâ€™s datetime.now() to fetch current time
â€“ Updated every second using Tkinterâ€™s after(1000, update_clock) method to create a non-blocking live timer
â€“ Designed the GUI using Tkinterâ€™s Label, customised fonts, and background themes (light/dark)
â€“ Responsive and lightweight â€“ ideal for embedding in larger apps later

ðŸ§® 2. Basic Calculator
â€“ Functional calculator that handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage and clear
â€“ Designed with Tkinter Button, Entry and Grid layout system for a neat keypad
â€“ Each button appends input to an expression string
â€“ On pressing =, expression is passed to eval() for safe evaluation
â€“ Handled invalid input with try-except block to avoid crashes and display "Error"
â€“ Optimised layout for both mouse and keyboard usage (<Key> events can be added)

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:
â€“ Language: Python 3.12
â€“ GUI Library: Tkinter (standard GUI package in Python)
â€“ Modules Used: datetime, math, eval, try-except for error handling

ðŸ“‚ Why I built these?
To strengthen my concepts of event-driven programming, widget layouting, state handling, and real-time data display â€” all fundamental for future desktop and embedded system applications.

âœ¨ Open to suggestions, improvements and feedback! Letâ€™s grow together ðŸš€
